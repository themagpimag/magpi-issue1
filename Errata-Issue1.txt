Make improvements to text layout if possible, to better group paragraphs/lines etc if possible.

If we have web-server space, can we put the RacyPy2_1.iso onto it (at the moment it is located within our public dropbox).

Page 22+:
Extra page here.

-VMPlayer Tips - box needs to have lighter background (match with box on Page 13).
Page 15:
Optional Pets Box - Background needs to be darker or headings text made lighter.


DONE 19/2/13 Meltwater - Page 18-19:
It seems we are removing the "The MagPi Issue 01 MAY 2012" text in the other articles, so best remove it here too.
JAVA LOGO!!!! We need the java script logo here. - Get this from Issue 2!
I assume we should be fine using the logos, but we may be best putting, "All logos and trademarks remain the property of their respective owners." or similar.  We shouldn't need permission to use them since they are simply listed as avaiable options, it should be clear that we are talking about multiple external sources.
