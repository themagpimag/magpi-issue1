The Dawn Of
Affordable
Computing

The ZX81 and Spectrum by Sinclair
Research, were among the first
affordable home computers available
during the early 1980's.

Although these 8-bit computers were
crude by today's standards, they gave
ordinary people the opportunity to
write computer programs and games.

The BBC Acorn computer was
backed by the British Government
for use in education and subsidies
were granted to schools. These
computers were a little too expensive
for most families to have at home.

The 'Electron' was Acorn's attempt at
addressing the price issue. They sold
a number of units, however despite
being more powerful on the hardware
side, the range of game titles was
significantly smaller than rivals
Sinclair and Commodore.
