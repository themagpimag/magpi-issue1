The Fall Of
Programming

Home computer users were becoming less interested in writing their own programs.

Slick-looking, professionally made games that were coming out of software publishing companies were compelling.

Ocean Software for example, boasted an impressive library of hit game titles such as 'Daley Thompson's Decathlon', 'Chase HQ' and 'New Zealand Story'.

The trend of moving away from programming followed within the education sector. Early software packages like Wordstar, and Lotus 123 were difficult to use before the days of the graphical interface, but typing skills, word processing, spreadsheet and database training continued to be the focus. Programming was seen as a very specialist and niche area of study.
