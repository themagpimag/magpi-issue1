A step-by-step guide to creating a virtual machine of the 'Debian Linux' operating system to run on your Windows PC.

An 'Operating System' (OS) is a set of instructions that help a computer to understand how to control the connected hardware devices.
The 'Boot Sequence' is a list of events that begins when you power up your computer.
A state of readiness is usually indicated when all the screen activity has stopped and you are confronted with a logon prompt or graphical user interface (GUI). In this example the GUI is called 'LXDE' - Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment.
