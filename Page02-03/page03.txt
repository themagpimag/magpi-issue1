If you like your apples to be white
and shiny, your apricots made
from silicon, and you'd rather talk
to your blackberries, then you
may be in for a treat...

The Raspberry Pi computer is the size of a
credit card, completely silent and costs under
£30. The operating system runs from an SD
flash card, allowing its personality to instantly
be switched by swapping cards. Its potential
uses are staggering, and as yet, not fully
explored, but it has already been tested as a
multimedia player with streaming capabilities,
a games machine, an internet browser and a
hardware development board. It is intended
to be used as an educational device for
people of all ages and skill levels.

Interest in the Raspberry Pi is already
incredible, and demand has far exceeded
expectations. IT professionals, electronics
experts and newcomers are all eager to get
their hands on the small device which
everybody agrees 'is going to be huge'.
